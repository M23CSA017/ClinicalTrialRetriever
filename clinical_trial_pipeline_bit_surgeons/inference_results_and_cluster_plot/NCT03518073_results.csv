1,NCT03367403,A Study of LY3002813 in Participants With Early Symptomatic Alzheimer's Disease (TRAILBLAZER-ALZ),"Change From Baseline in the Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale (iADRS) Score, Integrated Alzheimer's Disease Rating Scale is used to assess whether donanemab slows down the cognitive and functional decline associated with AD compared with placebo. iADRS is a simple linear combination of 13-item alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog13) and the Alzheimer's disease cooperative study-instrumental activities of daily living scale (ADCS-iADL). The scale ranges from 0 to 144, where lower scores indicate worse performance and higher score indicates better performance. Least Squares (LS) Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AChEI) and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks","Change From Baseline in the 13-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog13) Score, The ADAS is a rater administered instrument that was designed to assess the severity of the dysfunction in the cognitive and noncognitive behaviors characteristic of persons with AD. The cognitive subscale of the ADAS consists of 13 items assessing areas of cognitive function most typically impaired in AD: orientation, verbal memory, language, praxis, delayed free recall, digit cancellation. The ADAS--Cog13 scale ranges from 0 to 85. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) Score, CDR-SB is a semi-structured interview of participants and their caregivers. Participant's cognitive status is rated across 6 domains of functioning, including memory, orientation, judgment/problem solving, community affairs, home/hobbies, and personal care. Severity score assigned for each of 6 domains; Total score (SB) ranges from 0 to 18. Higher scores indicate greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score, MMSE is a brief screening instrument used to assess cognitive function (orientation, memory, attention, ability to name objects, follow verbal/written commands, write a sentence, and copy figures). Total score ranges from 0 to 30; lower score indicates greater disease severity. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (ADCS-iADL) Score, The ADCS-ADL is a 23-item inventory developed as a rater-administered questionnaire answered by the participant's caregiver. The ADCS-ADL measures both basic and instrumental activities (instrumental activity items 6a, 7-23) of daily living by participants. The range for the ADCS-iADL is 0-59 with higher scores reflecting better performance. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, pooled investigator, AChEI and/or memantine use at baseline, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Plaque Deposition as Measured by Florbetapir F18 Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Scan, Florbetapir PET imaging was used as a quantitative amyloid biomarker. Florbetapir PET scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in amyloid plaques. Quantitative amyloid burden was first formalized as the average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (SUVR) in six predetermined cortical areas of the brain relative to the cerebellum as a reference region. Larger SUVR reflects the larger cortical amyloid burden relative to cerebellum. SUVR values were further calibrated to a centiloid (CL) scale. The Centiloid scale anchor points are 0 and 100, where 0 represents a high-certainty amyloid negative scan and 100 represents the amount of global amyloid deposition found in a typical AD scan. Least Squares mean change was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates of baseline, baseline-by-visit, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Tau Deposition as Measured by Flortaucipir F18 PET Scan, Flortaucipir PET imaging was used as a quantitative tau biomarker. Flortaucipir PET scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in aggregated tau neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Quantitative tau burden was formalized using two measures: weighted average Standardized Uptake Value Ratio (MUBADA SUVR) in the brain relative to the cerebellum gray as a reference region and the global tau load (TauL) generated using a TauIQ method. Larger weighted average SUVR reflects the larger cortical tau burden relative to cerebellum gray. The TauIQ method quantifies the spatiotemporal accumulation pattern of tau and larger TauL value reflects the larger global tau level in the brain as determined using a TauIQ mathematical framework. Least Squares mean change was controlled for baseline + age + treatment (Type III sum of squares)., Baseline, 76 Weeks|Change From Baseline in Brain Volume as Measured by Volumetric Magnetic Resonance Imaging (vMRI), MRI scans at baseline and at 76 weeks after the first treatment were used to quantitatively estimate change in brain atrophy. Volumetric MRI (vMRI) parameters were measured in 14 brain regions: bilateral cortical, bilateral entorhinal cortex, bilateral hippocampus, bilateral inferior parietal lobe, bilateral isthmus cingulate, bilateral lateral parietal lobe, bilateral medial temporal lobe, bilateral precuneus, bilateral prefrontal lobe, bilateral superior temporal lobe, bilateral ventricles, bilateral whole brain, bilateral whole temporal lobe, and bilateral white matter. The atrophy was assessed by tensor-based morphometry, which captures volume changes within the deformation map. LS Mean value was controlled for fixed, categorical effects of treatment, visit and treatment-by-visit interaction, fixed covariates of baseline, and age at baseline., Baseline, 76 Weeks",Inclusion Criteria: Gradual and progressive change in memory function reported by participants or informants for 6 months.

2,NCT00667810,Study Evaluating The Efficacy And Safety Of Bapineuzumab In Alzheimer Disease Patients,"The Change From Baseline in the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog)/11 Total Score at Week 78, The ADAS-Cog is a multi-item, objective measure of cognitive function. The scale evaluates memory, language, and praxis with items such as orientation, word recall, word recognition, object identification, comprehension, and the completion of simple tasks. Analysis of the ADAS-Cog for this study was based upon an 11 item score from the following items 1) word recall task, 2) naming objects and fingers, 3) following commands, 4) constructional praxis, 5) ideational praxis, 6) orientation, 7) word recognition, 8) remembering test instructions, 9) spoken language ability, 10) word finding difficulty in spontaneous speech, and 11) comprehension. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified psychometric rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced. The ADAS-Cog/11 ranged from 0 to 70 points, with higher scores indicating a greater degree of impairment. A negative change from baseline indicates a decrease in cognitive impairment., 78 weeks|The Change From Baseline in the Disability Assessment for Demential (DAD) Total Score at Week 78, The DAD measures instrumental and basic activities of daily living in participants with Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The DAD is administered to the participants'caregiver in the form of an interview. This scale had to be administered by a trained and certified global rater who did not have access to any information regarding adverse events experienced by the participant. This scale assesses a participants' ability to initiate, plan, and perform activities related to hygiene, dressing, continence, eating, meal preparation, telephoning, going on an outing, finance and correspondence, medications, leisure, and housework. Each item can be scored as 1 = yes, 0 = no, non applicable = NA. A total score is obtained by adding the rating for each question and converting this total score out of 100. Higher scores indicate better function; a positive change from baseline indicates an improvement., 78 weeks","The Change From Baseline in Brain Amyloid Burden at Week 71., Brain amyloid burden as imaged by 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET). The latter is a semiquantitative measure of the extent of fibrillar amyloid in the brain. PIB PET measurements were made in cortical regions found to have the highest burden of fibrillar amyloid at autopsy in participants diagnosed as having Alzheimer's pathology, and also regions reported to have the highest average retention of PIB signal in previous PET studies enrolling participants with probable AD. This parameter reflects overall brain amyloid deposition as indexed by imaging. The change from baseline was measured as average standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) in prespecified regions of interest (ROI) assessed by PIB PET imaging in a subset of participants., 71 Weeks|The Change From Baseline in Phospho-tau Levels in the Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) at Week 71., Biomarkers CSF phospho-tau (p-tau) is an indicator of neuronal injury and neurodegeneration. An elevation in levels of tau, as well as specific p-tau species, is thought to be a marker for progressive cellular degeneration in AD. Accordingly, a reduction from baseline in levels of CSF tau in participants who received bapineuzumab compared with participants who received placebo may be indicative of a reduction in neuronal loss in participants treated with bapineuzumab., 71 Weeks|The Change From Baseline in Brain Volume at Week 71, Brain volume was examined in a subset of participants by Magnetic Resonance Imaging Brain Boundary Shift Integral (MRI BBSI). Cerebral atrophy correlates closely with the gradual cognitive decline in AD and can be visualized by MRI. The BBSI technique involves positional matching of serial 3-dimensional MRI brain images, such that brain MRI-image volumes were first registered and then subtracted from each other. Atrophy rates would generally be expected to be lower if the underlying disease was attenuated by effective treatment., 71 Weeks|Divergence of Effect on the ADAS-Cog/11 Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, The MMRM estimated slope (based on linear contrasts) of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo for the ADAS-Cog/11 total scores from Week 39 to Week 78 was presented., 39 Weeks|Divergence of Effect on the DAD Total Scores From Week 39 to Week 78, The MMRM estimated slope (based on linear contrasts)of the differences between bapineuzumab and placebo for the DAD total scores from Week 39 to Week 78 was presented., 39 weeks|Time to Median Placebo Deterioration on ADAS-Cog/11 Total Score (European Union","Inclusion Criteria: Diagnosis of probable Alzheimer Disease (AD), with Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of 16-26, and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) consistent with the diagnosis of AD Concurrent use of cholinesterase inhibitor or memantine allowed, if stable Caregiver will participate and be able to attend clinic visits with patientExclusion Criteria: Significant neurological disease other than AD Major psychiatric disorder Contraindication to undergo brain MRI",This is a study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of multiple doses of bapineuzumab in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer Disease.

AD causes brain cells to die. AD is thought to be caused by an excess of beta amyloid (β-amyloid), a sticky protein in the brain that forms amyloid plaques. At autopsy, AD patients are required to have these amyloid plaques in the brain in order to have a definitive diagnosis of AD. Inhibiting the enzyme gamma-secretase (γ-secretase) lowers the production of β-amyloid. Semagacestat (LY450139) is a functional γ-secretase inhibitor and was shown to lower β-amyloid in blood and spinal fluid in humans tested thus far and in blood, spinal fluid and brain in animals tested thus far. This study used several different tests to measure the effect of semagacestat on both β-amyloid and amyloid plaques for some patients. The buildup of amyloid plaques was measured by a brain scan that takes a picture of amyloid plaques in the brain. Other tests measured the overall function of the brain and brain size in some patients. In this trial, patients who initially received placebo (inactive sugar pill) were, at a certain point in the study, switched over to active drug, semagacestat. In other words, all patients could eventually receive active drug. Each patient's participation could last approximately 2 years. Patients taking approved AD medications were permitted to participate in this study and continue taking these medications during the study. All patients who completed this study had the option to continue receiving semagacestat by participating in an open label study.
